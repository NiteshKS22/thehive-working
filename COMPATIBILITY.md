# Compatibility Promise

## API
- All existing v0/v1 endpoints are preserved.
- No breaking changes to request/response bodies.

## Schema
- Database schema is frozen except for security patches requiring additive changes.

## Deprecation
- TheHive 3/4 are EOL upstream. This internal LTS supports them indefinitely for internal use.
